# MilestoneProject2_BookStoringSystem
As my second milestone project i was commended to write a console bookstore system.
This System should allow users to:
  - Enter and retrieve book deatails.
  - Mark books as read.
  - Delete existing books.
  - Search for books by Title, Author or books read
  - Store the list of books in a csv file to check it later.
